# computeFinalGrades FUNCTION - computes the average value on the 7-step-scale 
# of a vector that contains grades.
#
# Usage: gradesFinal = computeFinalGrades(grades)
#
# Input: grades - an N Ã— M matrix containing grades on the 7-step-scale given to N students on M different assignments.
#
# Output: gradesFinal - a vector which contains only the final grades on the 7-step-scale
